# Wolflings: Peril of the Pack

![Screenshot of first level of game](screenshots/level%201.png)

This game is a [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)) clone where you must guide wolf pups through perilous environments caused by climate change and irresponsible human behaviour.

Drag the water bucket over any fires to put them out. Likewise, apply the shovels to flooded tiles to make them passable.

Get enough wolfs to safety as you can!
